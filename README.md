# Apriori-algorithm-for-finding-frequent-itemsets
Optimized implementation of the Apriori algorithm in C++ with parallelization using OpenMP. It finds frequent itemsets in a set of transactions, efficiently handles anagrams, and utilizes a hash map for counting occurrences. The code prints frequent itemsets with counts and measures execution time. It's faster and scalable for large datasets
